# Strudel AI - AI EDM Composition Environment

This is a fork of Strudel (https://strudel.cc/), a Tidal-based live coding environment for music, being developed into an AI-powered EDM composition tool.

## Project Overview
- **Base**: Strudel - web-based live coding environment for algorithmic music
- **Goal**: Transform into AI-assisted electronic dance music composition platform
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript, uses Tidal Cycles pattern language

## Development Environment
- Use Python by sourcing `venv/bin/activate` for any Python components
- Main codebase is JavaScript/TypeScript based on Strudel
- OpenAI API keys available via `source ~/.bashrc`

## Key Areas for AI Enhancement
- Pattern generation and suggestion
- Sample selection and arrangement
- Beat and rhythm composition
- Harmonic progression generation
- Real-time performance assistance
- Style transfer and genre adaptation

## Code Conventions
- Follow existing Strudel patterns and conventions
- Maintain compatibility with Tidal Cycles syntax where possible
- Preserve live coding workflow while adding AI capabilities

## Testing
- Check package.json for available test scripts
- Run linting and type checking before commits

## Important Notes
- This is experimental AI music composition software
- Maintain the interactive, real-time nature of the original Strudel
- Focus on enhancing creative workflow, not replacing musician input
